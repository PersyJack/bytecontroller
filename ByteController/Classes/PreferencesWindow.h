 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 Window subclass for our preferences window. Among other things
 it gives us control over key equivalents. Also a delegate
 for the tab view, to enable animated window resize.
 NOTE: Should we handle tab view delegation to 
 PreferencesDelegate.h?
